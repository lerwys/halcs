Welcome to HALCS's documentation!
=================================
This document is the user's manual of HALCS, the software developed to abstract
hardware details, providing an easy to use interface to clients. The hardware,
in this case, is used in the broad sense, meaning an AMC board, a network-attached
device or any other piece of equipment meant to be integrated to a control system
or test-bench. The authoritative development location is the `HALCS Github Repository`_,
where you can find the latest developments, news and updates.
